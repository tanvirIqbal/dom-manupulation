# Dom Manupulation

### What is DOM

* DOM - Document Object Model
* Structured representation of an HTML Document
* The DOM is used to connect webpages to script like JavaScript
* For each HTML element, there is Object in the DOM that we can access and interact with.

### Event and Event Listener

* Events: Notification that are sent to notify the code that something happened on the webpage.
* Example: clicking a button, resizing a window, scrolling down or pressing a key
* Event Listener: A function that performs an action based on a certain event. It waits for a specific event to happen.

### Callback Function

* A function that is called by another function. We pass callback function as a parameter to the caller function without ()

### Anonymous function

* A function that doesn't have a name, we cannot reuse the anonymous function.
